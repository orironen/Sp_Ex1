data_structures.hpp
I implemented data structures for a list, queue, priority queue, and Union-Find.

Algorithms.cpp / Algorithms.hpp
includes implementations of BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Prim, and Kruskal algorithms.

Graph.cpp / Graph.hpp
includes an implementation of a graph using Edge and Vertex classes,
where each vertex maintains a list of its neighbors.
I chose to build the graph by traversing the list of neighbors of each vertex.

tests.cpp
includes relevant tests for the algorithms and data structures.

main.cpp
contains an example of running all the algorithms on a specific graph.
